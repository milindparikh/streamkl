streamkl is the library for streaming events from kafka.
streamkl is available under two different licenses. LGPL or the BSD license.

0.1.0 IS EXPERIMENTAL

The 0.1.0 version of streamkl provides elementary streaming capabilities for 
kafka 0.7.0 to .... It requires erlkafka 0.6.1 or later 
(github.com:milindparikh/erlkafka)

0.1.0 
     Streams events as they happen on kafka broker to browser. 
     
     Usage: 
       application:start(erlkafka_app).
       streamklw3_server:start_link(9990).   % 9990 is the port


     Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:9990/<topic>/style/<broker>/<partition>/offset
     
     http://127.0.0.1:9990/testtopic/default/0/0/0

     * 0.1.0 is experimental
     * The style does not do anything currently
     * You do need to know your offsets

      
     As you begin to pump events into the broker
         kafka_simple_api:produce(0, <<"testtopic">>, 0, [<<"Hello">>, <<"World">>]).
     You get to see events in the browser.

     If you don't push events and the streamer catches up, after a while
     it will stop the stream
